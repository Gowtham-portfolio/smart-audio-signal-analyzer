🎧 Smart Audio Signal Analyzer

Smart Audio Signal Analyzer is a practical audio processing project focused on improving audio clarity and understanding signal behavior.
The system records or processes audio signals, removes background noise, filters unwanted frequencies, and analyzes accuracy using clear visual charts.

This project reflects hands-on experience in audio signal processing, noise reduction, frequency analysis, and data visualization.

📌 What This Project Does

This system works with real-world audio and helps clean and analyze it step by step:

Records live audio or processes existing audio files

Removes background noise for better clarity

Filters specific frequency ranges (low, mid, high)

Compares original and processed signals

Shows results using easy-to-understand graphs and charts

The goal is to make audio signals cleaner, clearer, and easier to analyze.
